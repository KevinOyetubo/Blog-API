# Blog-API

This an the first API I've ever built and it's a part of my AltSchool end-of-semester project. Made with FastAPI with bits of user authentication, this is a rough code but it's aim is to test my capabilities.

The main thing is; due to my limited knowledge, the relationship between users and the blogs they create is not fully fleshed out. All that said, this is just a beginner starting out.
