# Blog-API

This an the first API I've ever built and it's a part of my AltSchool end-of-semester project. Made with FastAPI with bits of user authentication, this is a rough code but it's aim is to test my capabilities.

In this API ypu can create a user, the user created can then login through the authorization icon at the top of the swagger UI docs. An authorized user can create a blog and edit the blog later.

The main thing is; due to my limited knowledge, the relationship between users and the blogs they create is not fully fleshed out. All that said, this is just a beginner starting out. Due to that, the ralationship between my blogs and users table is a bit weird. When creating your blog, you will be asked to pass in a publisher id make sure the id is unique.
